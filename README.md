# SOLID PRINCIPLE
SOLID Principle basic:

1.Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

2.Open Close Principle

Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

3.Liskov Substitute

The Liskov Substitution Principle says that the object of a derived class should be able to replace an object of the base class without bringing any errors in the system or modifying the behavior of the base class.

4.Interface Segregation

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

5.Dependency Injection

Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. 
It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, 
but they should depend on abstractions.
